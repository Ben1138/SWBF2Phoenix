# SWBF2 Phoenix Project

This project is a re-implementation of the old Star Wars Battlefront II (2005) game, utilizing the Unity game engine.<br/>
It does so by loading all assets and scripts from the original game files at runtime, providing a compatible API layer for the original, compiled Lua scripts.<br/>
<br/>
This project aims for full compatibility with the vanilla game files, and as best as possible with custom maps.<br/>
